1. Thing: wide variety of devices.
2. controllers: 
3. sensor: input
4. Actuator: output
5. communicator: connect devices with each other.
## life cycle
- collect -> communication -> Analyze -> action
## IOT Architecture
1. Business layer
2. Application layer
3. network layer
4. physical /perception layer
## IOT Threat
- 41% : known vul, 33% malware  and 26% user practice.
1. Security and privacy issues: - 
    - 90% of thee device gather personal information
    - lack of data encryption and network access control.
2. Device integrity: 
    - invasive hardware attacks
    - side-channel attacks
    - Reverse-engineering attacks
3. software integrity
    - absence of anti-virus 
4. security issues in communication protocols
5. Hardware vulnerabilities:
    less emphasis on device security.
6. DOS and DDOs Attacks: 
7. wireless sensors networks (wsn)

## IOT network stack
1. CBOR: XML/JSON
2. CoAP: HTTP
3. UDP,IPV6
4. 6LOWNPAN
5. IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
6. IEEE 802.15.4 PHY
#### MQTT(MQ Telemetry Transport) protocols
- publish and Subscribe work with low cost and low bandwidth though unstable protocols.
1. Send command to control an output
2. Read and publish data.
- Publish and Subscribe
device one publishes on a topic and device two subscribe and receive message.
- Topics
Interest for incaming messages
specify where you want to publish.
Case sensetive
Home/office.
- MQTT Brokers

uses MQTT Broker:

## Threat to cloud IOT

## OSINT
- try to find system manuals.
- FCC ID: is a general body to regulate various devices emitting radio communication. fccidd.io
- patents: provide inner working of certain devices.
- IOT search engines: shodan , censys.
