# IoT Network-Based IDS & Malware Detection ‚Äî Team Project

## üìå Project Overview  
We are developing a **network-based intrusion detection system (IDS)** aimed at monitoring and protecting IoT devices on a home network. The system will include basic malware detection capabilities focusing on known malicious traffic patterns.

---

## üéØ Project Goals  
- Capture and analyze IoT network traffic  
- Detect intrusions and suspicious activities using rule-based signatures  
- Identify malware-related network behavior (e.g., connections to malicious IPs/domains)  
- Provide clear logging and alerting mechanisms  
- Build a simple dashboard/interface to visualize alerts (optional / stretch goal)
